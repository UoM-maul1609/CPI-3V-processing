Brief:
	*CPI3V processing code
	*A collection of files to process the roi files from the CPI3V
	*Extracts data blocks from *.roi files and saves
	*Processes the image data to file particle properties, boundaries, etc.
	*Writes images to png files for viewing
	*Calculates time-series of concentrations, segregated by particle properties
Running code:
	*MATLAB: in the directory /matlab there is code for MATLAB
	*edit the script batchProcess.m to point to the directory where the raw data are
	 (look at the "path1" variable)
	*edit the script batchProcess.m to point to the raw data files 
	 (look at the "filename1" variable)
	*type "batchProcess" at the MATLAB command prompt.
Using code:
    *The code has been written by Dr Paul Connolly, University of Manchester. 
    *It is available for collaborative use.
    *Please cite the original source of the code when using.
Data output:
	* a *.mat file is created for every *.roi processed and contain the image data in a
	  nice format for doing later analysis
	* a file called "full_backgrounds.mat" is also created, which contains all the 
	 background images in the files. If none are found the code will crash.
	* a folder with the date and "_gtxxx" will be created which contains images of 
		particles
	* a file called "timeseries.mat" will be created, which contains the processed
	  timeseries data, which is a struct containing arrays of data:
	  	 *conc2ar is the concentration binned by time, particle size and particle roundness
	  	 *conc2 is the concentration binned by time and particle size 
	  	 *conc is the concentration binned by time
Contributing development:
	* Plans is to add code so that the user can use the Python language
	* Contact the code owner to contribute ideas.
