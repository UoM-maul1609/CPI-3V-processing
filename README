	*Extracts data blocks from *.roi files and saves
	*Processes the image data to file particle properties, boundaries, etc.
	*Writes images to png files for viewing
	*Calculates time-series of concentrations, segregated by particle properties
Running code:
	*See the README in either the matlab or python directory
Using code:
    *The code has been written by Dr Paul Connolly, University of Manchester. 
    *It is available for collaborative use.
    *Please cite the original source of the code when using.
