Running code:
	*python: in the directory /python there is code for python
	*edit the script batchProcess.py to point to the directory where the raw data are
	 (look at the "path1" variable)
	*edit the script batchProcess.py to point to the raw data files 
	 (look at the "filename1" variable)
	*type "python batchProcess.py" at the command prompt.
Data output:
	* a *.mat file is created for every *.roi processed and contain the image data in a
	  nice format for doing later analysis
	* a file called "full_backgrounds.mat" is also created, which contains all the 
	 background images in the files. If none are found the code will crash.
	* a folder with the date and "_pygtxxx" will be created which contains images of 
		particles
	* a file called "timeseries.mat" will be created, which contains the processed
	  timeseries data, which is a struct containing arrays of data:
	  	 *conc2ar is the concentration binned by time, particle size and particle roundness
	  	 *conc2 is the concentration binned by time and particle size 
	  	 *conc is the concentration binned by time
